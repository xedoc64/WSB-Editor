## FAQ

### Which Windows version I need?
I tested this editor with Windows 10 1903 Build 18362.53. This should be the minimum version.

### I receive an error, when I clicked on the wsb file. What should I do?
Make shure that you installed the Windows Sandbox in the features.
Try to start the sandbox without the wsb file. If the sandbox won't start without the wsb file the best way is to go to https://answers.microsoft.com and ask there. If you can normaly use the sandbox and it doesn't start with the wsb file open a issue and attach the error message and wsb file and I will look into it.

### I use an Insider version of Windows and found, that the editor doesn't support all options available
If an option from the Insider version is finding a way into the enduser version I will implement that.

### I found an cool option which isn't in the editor.
If this option is working also in the normal Windows edition (not Insider) please open a suggestion which the documentation of that option.
